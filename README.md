# ðŸ“¸ UnsplashApp â€“ Modular Clean Architecture

This is a personal iOS project showcasing a modular **Clean Architecture** implementation using **Swift** and **SwiftUI**.  
Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate several of my technical skills, including architecture, modularization, API integration, and UI building.

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

To run the project:

1. Create a file named `Secrets.xcconfig` in the `UnsplashApp` target.
2. Add your Unsplash API key inside it:

   ```plaintext
	API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. You can get an API key by creating a developer account here:

If you encounter any issues with this step, feel free to reach out - I can provide my personal API key for testing purposes.
